# CP-FINAL

TURN ON THE LIGHT<br>
Turn on the light by geting close

Summary<br>
For this project, I will use arduino to code. And when you get close to the sensor,the light will turn on.


Component Parts<br>
The parts I will use are Arduino Uno, USB Cable, Breadboard, Wiress, Ultrasonic distance sensor and neo pixel. And also the coding to let them work.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:<br>
Timeline<br>
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?<br>

Week 0: Write Proposal<br>
Week 1:get some RGB LEDS and try how to turn it on by using sensor <br>
Week 2: try to change RGB to neo pixel (search about the code make neo pixel working)<br>
Week 3: deal with distance problem. And add a cover on it.<br>
Week 4: Present!<br>

Challenges<br>
Change RGB LEDS to neo pixel. And make accurate when we using sensor.<br>

Completed Work<br>
Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!<br>

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
