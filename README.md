# CP-FINAL

TURN ON THE LIGHT<br>
Turn on the light by geting close

Summary
For this project, I will use arduino to code. And when you get close to the sensor,the light will turn on.


Component Parts
The parts I will use are Arduino Uno, USB Cable, Breadboard, Wiress, Ultrasonic distance sensor and neo pixel. And also the coding to let them work.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
Timeline
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1:get some RGB LEDS and try how to turn it on by using sensor 
Week 2: try to change RGB to neo pixel (search about the code make neo pixel working)
Week 3: deal with distance problem. And add a cover on it.
Week 4: Present!
Challenges
Change RGB LEDS to neo pixel. And make accurate when we using sensor.

Completed Work
Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
